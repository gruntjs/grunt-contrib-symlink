# grunt-contrib-symlink v0.3.0

> Create symbolic links.



## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-contrib-symlink --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-symlink');
```




## Symlink task
_Run this task with the `grunt symlink` command._

Task targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide. Pay special attention to the [Building the files object dynamically](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#building-the-files-object-dynamically) section, which explains how to create many src-dest file mappings all at once.

Note that the symlink mode (file, dir) is determined automatically based on the src file type.

### Options

There are the following task-wide options available:


#### force

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

Set `force` to `true` to report errors but not fail the task, if the link creation is not so important for the task output.

### Usage Examples

```js
symlink: {
  // Enable overwrite to delete symlinks before recreating them
  options: {
    overwrite: false
  },
  // The "build/target.txt" symlink will be created and linked to
  // "source/target.txt". It should appear like this in a file listing:
  // build/target.txt -> ../source/target.txt
  explicit: {
    src: 'source/target.txt',
    dest: 'build/target.txt'
  },
  // These examples using "expand" to generate src-dest file mappings:
  // http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#building-the-files-object-dynamically
  expanded: {
    files: [
      // All child files and directories in "source", starting with "foo-" will
      // be symlinked into the "build" directory, with the leading "source"
      // stripped off.
      {
        expand: true,
        overwrite: false,
        cwd: 'source',
        src: ['foo-*'],
        dest: 'build'
      },
      // All child directories in "source" will be symlinked into the "build"
      // directory, with the leading "source" stripped off.
      {
        expand: true,
        overwrite: false,
        cwd: 'source',
        src: ['*'],
        dest: 'build',
        filter: 'isDirectory'
      }
    ]
  },
}
```

#### CLI overwrite option

To override the overwrite option via the CLI pass it as an option

```shell
  grunt symlink --overwrite
```

#### Usage tips on Microsoft Windows

Make sure your command prompt has administrative privileges, otherwise
the task will not work.
